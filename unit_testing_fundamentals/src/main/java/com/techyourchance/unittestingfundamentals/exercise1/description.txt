In this exercise you're going to write your first unit tests!

Description:
Your goal is to find all bugs in NegativeNumberValidator class without looking at its internal
implementation.
The test class NegativeNumberValidatorTest already exists.
You should:
1) Open the test class and set up system under test (SUT).
2) Cover the functionality of SUT with tests and identify which requirements aren't satisfied.
3) Read tests output and try to come up with a hypothesis about the production code.
4) Fix the production code.
5) Make sure that all tests pass.
