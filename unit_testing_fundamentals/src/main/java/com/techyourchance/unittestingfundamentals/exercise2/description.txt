Description:
Your goal is to find all bugs in StringDuplicator class without looking at its internal
implementation.
The test class StringDuplicatorTest already exists.
Assume all arguments and return values are non-nullable unless annotated with @Nullable annotation.
You should:
1) Open the test class and set up system under test (SUT).
2) Cover the functionality of SUT with tests and identify which requirements aren't satisfied.
3) Read tests output and try to come up with a hypothesis about the production code.
4) Fix the production code.
5) Make sure that all tests pass.
