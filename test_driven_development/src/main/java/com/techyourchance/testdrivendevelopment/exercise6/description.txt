Description:
Your goal is to implement FetchUserUseCaseSync interface using TDD.

The requirements:
1) If the user with given user ID is not in the cache then it should be fetched from the server.
2) If the user fetched from the server then it should be stored in the cache before returning to the caller.
3) If the user is in the cache then cached record should be returned without polling the server.

You should:
1) Create a new implementation of the interface WITHOUT writing any actual functionality.
2) Create a new test class for your implementation.
3) Write all the required tests.
4) Run the tests and ensure that all of them fail.
5) Write the required production code.
6) Run the tests and ensure that all of them pass. Debug if necessary.
7) Refactor the production code for readability and maintainability.
8) Refactor the test code for readability and maintainability.
9) Assign your implementation to SUT in the class FetchUserUseCaseSyncTestRef.
10) Ensure that all reference tests pass. Debug if necessary.
