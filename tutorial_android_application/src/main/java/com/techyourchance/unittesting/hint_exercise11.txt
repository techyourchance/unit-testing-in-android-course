Since FetchQuestionDetailsUseCase is a "global" object, meaning that the same instance will be
reused, it's reasonable to assume that over the lifetime of the application it will need to
fetch information for different questions.
To implement the caching functionality properly, you need to make sure that this use case can cache
multiple questions in parallel, and that each cached question has its own timeout.
Map data structure that stores question IDs as keys and some data as value can come in very handy.
