Description:
Your goal is to add in-memory caching functionality with timeout to FetchQuestionDetailsUseCase
using Uncle Bob's TDD technique. Set the timeout to 60 seconds.
FetchQuestionDetailsUseCase is a "global" object, meaning that the same instance will be reused
each time the user enters QuestionDetails screen.
To make your life easier, I already injected TimeProvider into FetchQuestionDetailsUseCase's
constructor. Therefore, you don't need to change any production code outside of this class in this
exercise.

The three rules of TDD are:
1) You are not allowed to write any production code unless it is to make a failing unit test pass
2) You are not allowed to write any more of a unit test than is sufficient to fail; and compilation failures are failures
3) You are not allowed to write any more production code than is sufficient to pass the one failing unit test

You should:
1) Think about all the required test cases for this functionality.
2) Test drive the implementation of the feature according to Uncle Bob's three rules of TDD.
   Always run all the tests to make sure that further changes don't break the existing functionality.
3) Refactor the production code.
4) Run the tests to make sure that all of them pass after the refactoring.
5) Refactor the tests code.
6) Run the tests to make sure that all of them pass after the refactoring.
7) Install the app and perform exploratory manual testing.
8) After you complete all the above steps, and before you review my solution, please read
   hint_exercise11.txt file. It contains a hint about specific test cases required for this
   functionality. If you already implemented them - great! If not, add them at this point.
