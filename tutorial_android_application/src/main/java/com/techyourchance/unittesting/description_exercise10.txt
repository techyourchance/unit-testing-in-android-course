Description:
Your goal is to extract application layer logic from QuestionDetailsFragment into standalone
controller using Uncle Bob's TDD technique.
I already created empty QuestionDetailsController class for you and set it up in
QuestionDetailsFragment.

The three rules of TDD are:
1) You are not allowed to write any production code unless it is to make a failing unit test pass
2) You are not allowed to write any more of a unit test than is sufficient to fail; and compilation failures are failures
3) You are not allowed to write any more production code than is sufficient to pass the one failing unit test

You should:
1) Create a new test class.
2) Think about the required test cases. In this case, it's totally alright to base test
   cases on QuestionDetailsFragment's implementation.
3) Test drive the implementation of QuestionDetailsController according to Uncle Bob's three rules of TDD.
   Always run all the tests to make sure that further changes don't break the existing functionality.
4) Refactor the production code.
5) Run the tests to make sure that all of them pass after the refactoring.
6) Refactor the tests code.
7) Run the tests to make sure that all of them pass after the refactoring.
8) Remove the implemented functionality from QuestionDetailsFragment.
9) Install the app and perform exploratory manual testing.

* Note that you don't need to ensure line coverage and perform mutation testing because
  you're using Uncle Bob's technique.
