Description:
Your goal is to find all bugs in UpdateUsernameUseCaseSync class without looking at its internal
implementation.
The test class UpdateUsernameUseCaseSyncTest already exists.
You should:
1) Open the test class and set up system under test (SUT).
2) Implement the required test doubles with Mockito.
3) Think about the required test cases and list them as comments.
4) Write actual tests and identify which requirements aren't satisfied.
5) Read tests output and try to come up with a hypothesis about the production code.
6) Fix the production code.
7) Make sure that all tests pass.
